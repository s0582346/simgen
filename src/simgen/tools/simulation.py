"""Lifecycle tools that operate on the assembled model as a whole.

Where the `create_*` builders in `simgen.tools.nodes` / `simgen.tools.edges`
populate the session model with components, these tools wire those components
together (`connect`), inspect the current graph (`get_model`), and run the
simulation (`run_simulation`).

Conventions (see architecture/simulation_tools.md):
  - fail with friendly ValueErrors on unknown ids, not raw KeyErrors,
  - FactorySimPy prints to stdout during connect/run; that is suppressed here so
    it can't corrupt the MCP stdio (JSON-RPC) channel.
