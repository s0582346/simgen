class BeltStore(Store):
    """
        This is a class that is derived from SimPy's Store class and has extra capabilities
        that makes it a priority-based reservable store for processes to reserve space
        for storing and retrieving items with priority-based access.

        Processes can use reserve_put() and reserve_get() methods to get notified when a space becomes
        available in the store or when an item gets available in the ReservablePriorityReqStore.
        These methods returns a unique event (SimPy.Event) to the process for every reserve requests it makes.
        Processes can also pass a priority as argument in the request. Lower values indicate higher priority.

        get and put are two methods that can be used for item storing and retrieval from ReservablePriorityReqStore.
        Process has to make a prior reservation and pass the associated reservation event as argument in the get and
        put requests. ReservablePriorityReqStore maintains separate queues for `reserve_put` and `reserve_get` operations
        to ensures that only processes with valid reservations can store or retrieve items.

        ReservablePriorityReqStore preserves item order by associating an unreserved item in the store with a reservation event
        by index when a reserve_get() request is made. As a result, it maintains a list of reserved events to preserve item order.

        It also allows users to cancel an already placed reserve_get or reserve_put request even if it is yielded.
        It also handles the dissociation of the event and item done at the time of reservation when an already yielded
        event is canceled.

        Attributes:
           reserved_events (list):  Maintains events corresponding to reserved items to preserve item order by index
           reserve_put_queue (list): Queue for managing reserve_put reservations
           reservations_put (list): List of successful put reservations
